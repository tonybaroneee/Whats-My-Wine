    description: Literal translation? "Ice wine." The harvest of these wines is very rare as it only occurs during the first hard frost that freezes the last of the grapes that remain on the vine. The grapes are then picked and pressed frozen so very little water gets in to the press and only a small amount of highly concentrated juice is extracted. The result is an extraordinary bond between sweetness and acidity.
